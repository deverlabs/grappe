 * teVirtualMIDI.sys is a kernel-mode device-driver which can be used to dynamically create & destroy
 * midiports on Windows (XP to Windows 8, 32bit & 64bit).  The "back-end" of teVirtualMIDI which is
 * defined by this include file of teVirtualMIDI can be used to create & destroy such ports and receive
 * and transmit data from/to those created ports.
 *
 * The DLL sets the last-error for the thread that called one of the functions below when
 * internal errors come up - those errors can be retrieved via GetLastError().
 * Here some of the more specific errors that you can encounter:
 *
 * ERROR_OLD_WIN_VERSION:
 *	Your Windows-version is too old for dynamic MIDI-port creation.
 *	You need at least Service-Pack 2 XP and W2K3.  Vista and Windows 7 work out of the box
 *
 * ERROR_INVALID_NAME:
 *	The name you specified contains invalid characters or is too short.
 *
 * ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS,ERROR_ALIAS_EXISTS:
 *	The name you specified is already existing (either as a port created by virtualMIDI or
 *	by another MIDI-driver)
 *
 * ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND:
 *	The driver could not be opened.  Possibly the driver was not installed or is inactive.
 *
 * ERROR_REVISION_MISMATCH:
 *	Due to some installation issue the virtualMIDIxx.dll in use and the virtualMIDI.sys
 *	driver-version do not match.  Therefore operation is not possible!

 *
 * This callback is called in an arbitrary thread-context - so make sure you have all your locking in order!
 *
 * If you have created the virtual-MIDI-port and specified TE_VM_FLAGS_PARSE_RX in the flags parameter, you will
 * receive a fully valid, preparsed MIDI-command with each callback.  The maximum size of data will be the amount
 * you specified in maxSysexLength.  Invalid commands or Sysex-commands with a length in excess of maxSysexLength
 * will be discarded and not forwarded to you.  Realtime-MIDI-commands will never be "intermingled" with other
 * commands (either normal or Sysex) in this mode.  If a realtime-MIDI-command is detected, it is sent to the
 * application before the command that it was intermingled with.
 *
 * In case of the driver being deactivated, the callback is called one time with a midiDataBytes==NULL and
 * length==zero, either the driver has been disabled, or another application using the driver has started
 * the installation of a newer driver-version
 *
 * You can throttle the speed of your virtualMIDI-port by not returning immediately from
 * this callback after you have taken care of the data received.
 *
 * If you want to throttle to 31250 bps for example, you need to place this line
 * before you return from your callback-function:
 *
 * Sleep( length * 10 * 1000) / 31250 );

/* virtualMIDICreatePortEx2 - this is the current intended function to create a virtual MIDI-port.
 *
 * You can specify a name for the device to be created. Each named port can only exist once on a system.
 *
 * When the application terminates, the port will be deleted (or if the public front-end of the port is already in use by a DAW-application,
 * it will become inactive - giving back apropriate errors to the application using this port.
 *
 * In addition to the name, you can supply a callback-interface, which will be called for all MIDI-data received by the virtual-midi port.
 * You can also provide instance-data, which will also be handed back within the callback, to have the ability to reference port-specific
 * data-structures within your application.
 *
 * If you specify "NULL" for the callback function, you will not receive any callback, but can call the blocking function "virtualMIDIGetData"
 * to retrieve received MIDI-data/commands.  This is especially useful if one wants to interface this library to managed code like .NET or
 * Java, where callbacks into managed code are potentially complex or dangerous.  A call to virtualMIDIGetData when a callback has been
 * set during the creation will return with "ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION".
 *
 * If you specified TE_VM_FLAGS_PARSE_RX in the flags parameter, you will always get one fully valid, preparsed MIDI-command in each callback.
 * In maxSysexLength you should specify a value that is large enough for the maximum size of Sysex that you expect to receive.  Sysex-commands
 * larger than the value specified here will be discarded and not sent to the user.  Realtime-MIDI-commands will never be "intermingled" with
 * other commands (either normal or Sysex) in this mode.  If a realtime-MIDI-command is detected, it is sent to the application before the
 * command that it was intermingled with.
 *
 * If you specify a maxSysexLength smaller than 2, you will receive fully valid preparsed MIDI-commands, but no Sysex-commands, since a
 * Sysex-command must be at least composed of 0xf0 + 0xf7 (start and end of sysex).  Since the parser will never be able to construct a
 * valid Sysex, you will receive none - but all other MIDI-commands will be parsed out and sent to you.
 *
 * When a NULL-pointer is handed back to the application, creation failed.  You can check GetLastError() to find out the specific problem
 * why the port could not be created.
